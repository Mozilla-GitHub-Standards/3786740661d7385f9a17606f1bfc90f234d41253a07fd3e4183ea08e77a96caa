# mozplatform-jenkins-jobs
Jobs for the Platform QA Jenkins instance.

This repository contains the jobs for the Platform QA Jenkins instance. Note that the
master branch will not contain any content.

This repo should be configured as a submodule for mozplatform-jenkins-config with the
directory name 'jobs'. Each branch is a Jenkins instance. For instance, 'pf-platform'
is in Mountain View, and 'home' is at Syd Polk's house in Austin.
